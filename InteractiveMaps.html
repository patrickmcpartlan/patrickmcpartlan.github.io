<h3>The Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI) aims at capturing the level of integration into the existing liner shipping network 
    by measuring liner shipping connectivity. It can be calculated at the country and the port level. 
    LSCI can be considered a proxy of the accessibility to global trade through to proxy of its shipping network. 
    The higher the index, the easier it is to access a high capacity and frequency global maritime freight transport system and 
    effectively participate in international trade. Therefore, LSCI can be jointly considered as a measure of connectivity to 
    maritime shipping and as a measure of trade facilitation. It reflects the strategies of container shipping lines seeking to 
    maximize revenue through market coverage. <ul>The index is calculated based on six major components:</ul>
</h3>
<P>SCHEDULED SHIP CALLS</P>
<P>DEPLOYED CAPACITY</P>
<P>NUMBER OF SHIPPING COMPANIES AND LINER SERVICES</P>
<P>AVERAGE AND VESSEL SIZE</P>
<P>DIRECTLY CONNECTED PORTS</P>
